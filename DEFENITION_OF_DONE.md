# Definition of done

For a card to be marked as "done" it shall pass the following checklist. Exceptions may be allowed if the Product Owner agrees to it.

- Comments shall exist for each piece of code.
- Code shall be committed and working in our version control system.
- Manual tests are defined and performed (see [TESTING][TESTING.md])
- The group shall have an understanding if something is to be marked as done. And understand how it works.
- All commits shall be clean and concise.
- At the end of a sprint, all done branches shall be merged with main and pass existing manual tests. (If applicable)
- All code shall be refactored and bad praxis shall be minimized. This implies that all variables in TypeScript needs to be typed, even those retrieved from a JSON API.
